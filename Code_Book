- Variables description
The variables that contain the data from the dowload files are: 
•	x_train, 
•	y_train, 
•	x_test, 
•	y_test, 
•	subject_train and 
•	subject_test
the variables that merge the previous datasets to further analysis are:
•	x_data, 
•	y_data and 
•	subject_data
the variable features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in. 
there is a variable that is a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
•	 mean_and_std_features,
Variable activities
•	A variable that has a similar approach is taken with activity names through the all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
•	averages_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development

- Description of the DATA
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. and the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) – both using a low pass Butterworth filter.
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 

- Work performed to clean up the data
1.	 Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
2.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5.	Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
